# rust-pearls
My little collection of Rust-related development pearls.

### crates
- [ratatui](https://crates.io/crates/ratatui) - a really nice terminal UI framework.
- [color-eyre](https://crates.io/crates/color-eyre) - beautiful panics, based on [eyre](https://crates.io/crates/eyre). Includes alternative macros for [anyhow](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow).
- [anyhow](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) - a popular and easy-to-use error handling library.
- [chumsky](https://crates.io/crates/chumsky) - an amazing composable parser/combinator.
- [logos](https://crates.io/crates/logos) - stupid-simple lexers
- [ariadne](https://crates.io/crates/ariadne) - beautiful parsing errors (works well together with [chumsky](https://crates.io/crates/chumsky), by the same author.
- [thiserror](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror) - convenience derive macro for stdlib's `Error` trait (makes custom errors painless).
