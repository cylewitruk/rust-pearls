# rust-pearls
My little collection of Rust-related development pearls.

### crates
- [Ratatui](https://crates.io/crates/ratatui) - a really nice terminal UI framework.
- [color-eyre](https://crates.io/crates/color-eyre) - beautiful panics.
- [chumsky](https://crates.io/crates/chumsky) - an amazing composable parser/combinator.
- [logos](https://crates.io/crates/logos) - stupid-simple lexers
- [ariadne](https://crates.io/crates/ariadne) - beautiful parsing errors (works well together with [chumsky](https://crates.io/crates/chumsky), by the same author.
